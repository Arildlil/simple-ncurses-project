# simple-ncurses-project

This is a new side project of mine, where I will try to create a simple game for the Linux terminal. The main purpose of the project is to learn more about the usage of external libraries in C, unit testing and test driven development. It's currently unknown what the game will turn out to become, other than being played in the normal bash terminal, using the ncurses library.

# Build and run

To build the project, make sure that the 'ncurses' library in installed. Then do:

```c
make app
make run
```
